      <h3>College Management System</h3>
      <p>A comprehensive web application built using PHP and MySQL, designed to streamline and automate various administrative tasks within a college environment. This system handles key operations such as student registration, fee management, attendance tracking, and academic results processing. It enhances overall efficiency, reduces manual workload, and ensures that students, faculty, and administrators can access accurate information in real-time. By centralizing college data and providing secure access through a user-friendly interface, the platform significantly improves decision-making and communication across departments.</p>

                        <h4>A Deep Learning Framework for Multi-Speaker Video Dubbing Using Whisper, NLLB and Wav2Lip</h4>
                        <p class="date">On Progress....</p>
                        <p class="description">This project presents an AI-driven automated video dubbing system that enables seamless multilingual content generation from single-language source videos. The system focuses on preserving natural lip synchronization and maintaining character-specific voice modulation to enhance the realism and immersion of dubbed content. By integrating state-of-the-art AI models, the platform ensures high-quality translation and dubbing across multiple languages. The architecture leverages Whisper (OpenAI) for accurate speech recognition, NLLB (Meta) for efficient and context-aware translation, Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems for dynamic and customizable voice generation, and Wav2Lip for realistic lip-syncing. These components are orchestrated through a robust backend powered by FastAPI, which handles all AI inference processes. </p>
